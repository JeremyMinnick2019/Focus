#Focus

Many small business owners, particularly those with businesses that have become successful without an official model, struggle to prioritize and delegate the various actions that allow a business to be maintenanced regularly and draw new clients.

Focus is a Single Page App designed to help small business owners organize their responsibilities into departments of actions and then actions themselves.

The user will able to create, read, add, edit and delete actions, as well as check off checklist items. This app will help the small business owner to eliminate distractions, group all daily and longer term objectives in one place, and allow tracking for all actions.

The backend solution of this application can be opened and run in Visual Studio, and then simultaneously the frontend code can be opened in Visual Studio Code and "yarn start" entered into the VS Code terminal. The browser window will display the interface which will then be connected to the backend api. Actions can then be created, updated, and deleted. The various endpoints can be viewed.

For full functionality, the user will also need to install the necessary libraries into the VS Code terminal which are: "Yarn add moment" (for the time stamp function) and "Yarn add confetti-js --save" (for the confetti visual effect when user clicks checkbox to complete an action).
